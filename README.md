The investigation includes a comparative analysis of five internal structures:  an empty cavity, serial plate arrangement, pipe structure, wavy-fin plate  design, and an obstruction-type configuration.
Through detailed CFD simulations, we assess the performance of these structures in terms of heat transfer efficiency and flow characteristics.
This analysis aims to provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of exhaust heat exchangers for TEGs.
